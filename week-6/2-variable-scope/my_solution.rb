# Release 0:
# Write your conclusions here.
# 1. Ruby warns me about the creation of a Global varibale and that i should be carefull with it as it has complete
#scope over my program
# 2. When i change the varibale of the constant ruby lets me do it but first it warns me that i had cÂ¡just change a
# constant value and that by itself its suspicious to it.
# 3. Ruby warns me that by creatting a class variable on the top level of the program now all instances of Object
# That are all the objects in the program now have that variable set to them and this most be some kind of mistake,
# class variables never should be on the toplevel they should be inside a Class object.
# 4. As for the local varibale Ruby its teling me that that varibale is out of the scope of where im running the
# program so its unable to acces the variable and returns a NameError.

# Release 3: Reflection

# This was also an easy but very valuable challenge that really lets yous gasp when to use each kind of variable
# , now i have clear that i have to use @@class varibales when i need  a variable that applies to all instance
# of a class or that store information about each instance of the class, instead i would use @instance variables
# to store information particular for each instance of a class so that and instace can not modified the same variable
# for another instance.

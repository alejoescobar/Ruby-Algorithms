#Separate Numbers with Commas

## Learning Competencies
- Break a large problem down into smaller steps
- Implement a method based on pseudocode
- Iterate through data structures and manipulate the content
- Research and use Ruby methods
- Use strings, integers, arrays, and/or hashes

## Summary
Write a method `separate_comma` which takes an integer as its input and returns a comma-separated integer as a string. Like this:

```ruby
separate_comma(1000)    # => "1,000"
separate_comma(1000000) # => "1,000,000"
separate_comma(0)       # => "0"
separate_comma(100)     # => "100"
```

*NOTE: Even if you are comfortable with regular expressions, do not use them in this challenge, it's all about the logic!*

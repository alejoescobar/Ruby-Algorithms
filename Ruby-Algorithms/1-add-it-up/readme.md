# Add it up!

## Learning Competencies
- Break a large problem down into smaller steps
- Implement a method based on pseudocode
- Iterate through data structures and manipulate the content
- Research and use Ruby methods

## Summary
In this challenge you will write two methods that add elements of an array. In the first, you will be adding numbers and calculating a total. In the second method, you will add strings and make them into a sentence.

The code should work as follows:

```ruby
total([1,2,3])      # => 6
total([4.5, 0, -1]) # => 3.5
total([-100, 100])  # => 0
```

To write pseudocode, first identify the input and output. What will the method receive as an argument (input)? What will be returned (output)? Then outline the steps you'll need to implement to solve the problem using `Array` methods (you can view these in [ruby-docs for arrays](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Array.html)).

Translate your pseudocode into code.

I directed you to use `Array` methods in your first solution, but there are many powerful methods built in to the Enumerable module that can do a lot of that work for you. Navigate to the [ruby-docs for Enumerables](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Enumerable.html). Once you're there, scroll down to see if any of these methods would be useful to do what you want to do. The docs are difficult to read, so start getting practice now.

You should be able to shorten your total method to one line using a specific enumerable method. I'm telling you this to help you look for a specific method, but please don't think all methods should be shortened to one line. Short methods are great as long as the code is readable. By that, I mean that it should be easy to tell what the code is doing simply by scanning it.


## Release 2: Pseudocode sentence_maker
Now go through the same process for a method `sentence_maker`. `sentence_maker` which takes an `Array` of strings and returns each element joined into a sentence.

*Note: The first letter should be capitalized and the sentence should end with a period.*

```ruby
sentence_maker(["i", "want", "to", "go", "to", "the", "movies"])
# => "I want to go to the movies."
```
